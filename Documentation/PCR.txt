   - Term1_SendStr -Send string to terminal.
   - Term1_SendNum -Send number to terminal.
   - Term1_SendFloatNum -Send a float number to the terminal. Due to the transformations the maximum float number is limited 
                according to the following conditions:     - positive number: 9 digits for integer part with 4 digits for 
                fractional part.     - negative numbers: 8 digits for integer part with 4 digits for fractional part.

                feed (CRLF) escape sequence as a string termination.

Module "AD1"       (component ADC_LDD)
   - AD1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - AD1_StartSingleMeasurement -This method starts one measurement of the selected group of samples and exits immediately. 
                This is ADC SW trigger method. The group of samples for measurement is specified by preceding call to 
                <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup> method.     DMA disabled: The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is 
                invoked after the measurement is done and if the event is enabled. Results of the measurement can be read by 
                the <GetMeasuredValues()> method.     DMA enabled: DMA request from configured ADC is enabled automatically. 
                The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is invoked after the requested number of results are transferred to 
                destination buffer by DMA and if the event is enabled. <GetMeasuredValues()> method is not available if DMA 
                mode is enabled. If the DMA transfer was completed before and DMA is not recofingured, DMA error can occur. See 
                also <SetBuffer()> method.     The state of the measurement can be also polled by the 
                <GetMeasurementCompleteStatus()> method. The <Discontinuous mode> doesn't support this method.
   - AD1_StartLoopMeasurement -This method starts periodic measurement of the selected group of and exits immediately. This is 
                ADC SW trigger method. The group of samples for measurement is specified by preceding call to 
                <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup> method.     DMA disabled: The <OnMeasurementComplete()> event is 
                invoked after the each measurement is done and the event is enabled. Results of the measurement can be read by 
                the <GetMeasuredValues()> method.     DMA enabled: DMA request from configured ADC is enabled automatically. 
                The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is invoked after the requested number of results are transferred to 
                destination buffer by DMA and the event is enabled. When DMA transfer is finished, DMA request is automatically 
                disabled by HW, but ADC loop mode is not stopped. In order to start new loop measurement with DMA, DMA must be 
                reconfigured by <SetBuffer()> method. <GetMeasuredValues()> method is not available if DMA mode is enabled.     
                The state of the measurement can be also polled by the <GetMeasurementCompleteStatus()> method. This method is 
                available only if HW supports loop measurement. The <Discontinuous mode> doesn't support this method.
   - AD1_StartLoopTriggeredMeasurement -This method prepares recurring measurement of the selected group of samples and exits 
                immediately. Multiple measurements of the selected sample group are done, but each measurement of the sample 
                group is not started until the trigger comes. Beware of trigger overflow (next trigger comes before the 
                previous measurement is done). This is ADC HW trigger method.   The group of samples for measurement is 
                specified by preceding call to <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup> method.     DMA disabled: The 
                <OnMeasurementComplete()> event is invoked after the each measurement is done and the event is enabled. Results 
                of the measurement can be read by the <GetMeasuredValues()> method.     DMA enabled: DMA request from 
                configured ADC is enabled automatically. The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is invoked after the requested 
                number of results are transferred to destination buffer by DMA and the event is enabled. When DMA transfer is 
                finished, DMA request is automatically disabled by HW, but ADC loop mode is not stopped. In order to start new 
                loop measurement with DMA, DMA must be reconfigured by <SetBuffer()> method. <GetMeasuredValues()> method is 
                not available if DMA mode is enabled.     The state of the measurement can be also polled by the 
                <GetMeasurementCompleteStatus()> method.This method is available only if HW supports triggered measurement and 
                <Trigger> is enabled.
   - AD1_GetMeasuredValues -This method copies results of the last measurement to the user supplied buffer. Data size depends 
                on the size of measured sample group (see <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup()> method). Data 
                representation is defined by the <Result type> property. Typically this method is called from 
                <OnMeasurementComplete> event to get results of the last measurement. This method is not available if DMA is 
                enabled.
   - AD1_SelectSampleGroup -This method selects one of the (design-time) predefined <Static sample groups> for the next 
                measurement. Each call rewrites the preceding setting. Once any group is selected, the measurement can be 
                started multiple times. Note: This method works only with the sample groups defined at design time. For 
                run-time defined groups use <CreateSampleGroup()> method.

   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask). The 
                method is not available if the counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU1_Disable -Disables the component - it stops signal generation and events calling. The method is not available if the 
                counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU1_SetEventMask -Enables/disables event(s). The events contained within the mask are enabled. Events not contained within 
                the mask are disabled. The component event masks are defined in the PE_Types.h file. Note: Event that are not 
                generated (See the "Events" tab in the Component inspector) are not handled by this method. In this case the 
                method returns ERR_PARAM_MASK error code. See also method <GetEventMask>.
   - TU1_GetPeriodTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks before re-initialization. See also method <SetPeriodTicks>. This 
                method is available only if the property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.
   - TU1_ResetCounter -Resets counter. If counter is counting up then it is set to zero. If counter is counting down then
